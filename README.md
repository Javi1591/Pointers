# Pointers

A C++ console application project designed to demonstrate the use of pointers, pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, and related concepts. Built using Visual Studio (or another C++ development environment) as part of a classroom assignment.

---

## Project Overview

This project covers these core concepts:

- Declaring pointer variables and initializing them with addresses of other variables.  
- Using the address-of operator (`&`) and the dereference operator (`*`).  
- Performing pointer arithmetic (where appropriate).  
- Allocating and deallocating dynamic memory using `new` and `delete`.  
- Passing pointers to functions for in-place modification of data.  
- Validating pointer use and avoiding common pitfalls (null pointers, dangling pointers).  
- Printing addresses and values to help visualize how pointers work.

---

## Features

- Prompt the user for input (e.g., values to store in variables and then operate on via pointers).  
- Demonstrate basic pointer operations: setting up, dereferencing, pointing to arrays, pointer increments.  
- Use dynamic memory to allocate arrays of values, then free the memory properly.  
- Display both the values and the memory addresses (for learning purposes) to illustrate pointer behavior.  
- Include input validation to avoid invalid pointer use or memory leaks.

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++ (compatible with C++11 or later)  
- IDE: Visual Studio 2019/2022 (or any C++ development environment)  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a machine with a C++ compiler (Visual Studio preferred) and familiarity with basic C++ (variables, loops, functions).

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Javi1591/Pointers.git
cd Pointers
